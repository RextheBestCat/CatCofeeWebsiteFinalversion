            <p>Timmi is a very gentle and relaxed cat, he likes to be pet and lie in ones lap. Although
            he will not leave you alone, if he has chosen you, so don't even think of not giving in to him
            cause otherwise he will make his annoyance heard. He loves the outdoors, so it is likely to see him
            in nearby parks. If he were to
            work somepaw else, it would probably a Therapist. Ps: he loves being pet
            behind his right ear.</p>

            <p>Frida once was a stray, however, she came to us a few years ago. She is a bit
                anxious, and very shy. But once she gets to know you she is a very loving furrball.
            Another thing about her is that she is quite intelligent, managing to open doors repeatedly.
            She even taught her skill to other cats. And of course, opening the snackboxes is her goto trick.
            Other than that, her favourite activities are purring and sleeping.</p>

            <p>Minzie is a gentle giant. The big and fluffy Main Coon will captivate you with her kind nature and
                graceful demands for pets. She loves to sit in one's lap while looking out of the windows, watching the
                other cats. </p>

            <p>Despite a grey blue british-short-hair,
                Balu's personality is neon orange. His unpredictable caos usually
                comes in the form of a blue blur, either when running across the rooms
                at record speeds, when he has knocked over a guest's Coffee, when
                snatching someone's slice of ham, or because the other cats annoy him.
                Around the end of the day however he becomes very relaxed, or exhausted, one
                could not tell the difference. Then he even becomes almost as cuddly as Minzie</p>
